The above static chart is designed to look aesthetically good with legend given in accordance with the status of the companies which is being divided into five categories, and the chart represents each company's status during the rise and fall of new covid cases over a period in accordance with the date a company was incorporated. 

However, the newly incorporated companies in the covid-19 pandemic period does not seem to do well, which can be inferred from the statistical chart that the companies included **between January 2020 and October 2020** have seen a substantial number of companies being at the proposal to strike off. Even some of them at the verge of liquidation. From the start of 2021, few companies were set up, but the ones in an active status even though the pandemic reached its peak at a point, which also justifies that the economy was starting to revive.

From The Visualization shown above, we can infer that there has been a considerable number of companies with outstanding mortgages during the pandemic out of which a part was satisfied by the companies, but was not satisfied as we can see that most of the companies have a minimum of one mortgage outstanding. Some large companies even have a high number of mortgage charges due, and again we can see that the outstanding mortgages were high during the early pandemic era, which then decreased from early 2021. 

The above bubble chart represents the number of mortgages outstanding and being Satisfied with the size of the bubble corresponding to the number of delinquent mortgages and the color of the bubbles concerning the number of mortgages being satisfied. 

The colors of the bubble plots are set soothingly peaceful and straightforward for easy interpretation using the interactive features, which can be seen by just hovering over the bubble plots.

The above Static Histplot represents the account categories been filed during the pandemic, which has nine types with corresponding pastel colors in reverse, which gives the plot a pleasant representation with grey being the most dominant color, which shows the volume account categories for many mortgages. 

From the above chart, we can infer that most companies with one outstanding mortgage have not filed accounts. In contrast, a substantial number of companies have a total exemption compared to the companies with a micro-entity, small and Dormant accounts. It is the same case for every other number of mortgages outstanding except for the companies with a high number of mortgages that have filed any statements.
